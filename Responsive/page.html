<h1>Hamsters are awesome!!</h1>
<p class="font">I love hamsters. They're very small and cute and fun to play with. Plus, there are so many different varieties of hamsters; even among the two main types (dwarf and standard) there are a lot of different species to enjoy. The hamster pictured above is a Syrian hamster, how cute!</p> <p class="font"> My personal favourite type of hamster is the banded syrian hamster-- the thick white stripe across their torso, occasionally with white speckles elsewhere, is a very cute look to me! I'm also quite fond of Roborovski dwarf hamsters; their mouse-like ears are very endearing to me, and they have unique proportions compared to most other hamsters.</p>
