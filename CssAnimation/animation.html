The opposite of a sunset is sunrise. <br> In literature and artworks, sunsets are typically symbolic of an ending-- think of the cowboys riding off into the sunset at the end of a film. <br> Additionally, sunsets are considered to be a quite romantic time of day, despite their associations with an ending. </p>
