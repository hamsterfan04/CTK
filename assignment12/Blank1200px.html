		<span id="date">October 18th, 2024.</span>
		<p id="featuredP">This piece is a drawing I made because I like fall a lot, so I wanted to draw a character in a fall setting. The character featured is Ryota Mitarai from the Danganronpa franchise. This piece was done digitally on my iPad, using ibisPaint. While drawing, I referenced many of my own personal photos during fall to capture the warm orange hues of the season.</p>

		<h2 id="featuredH2">"Porcelain"</h2>
		<span id="date">November 9th, 2024.</span>
		<p id="featuredP">In a recent trip to an antique mall, I spotted a porcelain mask that inspired me. I used that mask as inspiration for the makeup and "outfit", as well as the choice to exclude a body.</p>

		<div class="f-carousel__slide"><img class="imgleft spiral" src="https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:6aszctm7k6d2fiqngpjoh6xu/bafkreihip7agus2f56fwig6sg2knca5kjfvd4omroxzr4ecc45ogsl364u@jpeg">
		<h2 id="featuredH2">"Spiraling"</h2>
		<span id="date">October 8th, 2024.</span>
		<p id="featuredP">In my art, I find myself settling in to a routine. This piece was an attempt to break out of that, and to expand my skills or the reach of my abilities. Compared to the rest of my portfolio, I believe this piece is a bit of an outlier; all the more reason to love it. The bright, contrasting colors and texturing is not a usual part of my style, but after this drawing, I did begin branching out more to create more unique or stylized artworks.</p>
