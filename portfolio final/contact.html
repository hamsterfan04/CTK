<h2 class="contactsub">About Me</h2>
<p>Ever since I was young, I've enjoyed art. I've been drawing as long as I can remember, and it's consistenly been one of the things to bring me joy in my life. While I primarily focus on art, another passion of mine is web design. I discovered my passion for this in 2022, and have been teaching myself, as well as taking university courses, to hopefully start a career in the field. Web design is something I greatly enjoy, as it feels like a chance to follow a mathematical formula to achieve a functional, and beautiful result. I'd consider myself a bit of a perfectionist, and the straigtforward nature of web design has given itself well to that. I've found that I can focus at an entirely new level while working on a site, perfecting everything down to the individual pixel. No detail is left untouched!</p>
<hr>
<p>I was born and Raised in Sycamore, Illinois, alongside my parents and two siblings. My family have been my biggest supporters from the getgo, and I've always been able to rely on them for encouragement and critique where needed. This sort of open support has pushed me to aspire for greatness, and, hopefully some day, achieve it.</p>
