    <p>The navigation link boxes are all the same width regardless of the amount of text inside. Make the nav link backgrounds change when you roll over them. Make sure all the text in the links changes color when you roll over them (even the link in the hi). The main header and navigation have gradients in the background. Clicking on the ISU image in the footer should open the ISU main site in a new window/tab. All three of your pages should have the same format for the headers, navigation, and footer. This paragraph is justified, the others are not.

		<p><a href="#">This is a link.</a> The view of the earth from the moon fascinated me - a small disk, 240,000 mniles away. It was hard to think that that little thing held so many problems, so many frustrations. Raging nationalistic interests, famines, wars, pestilence don't show from that distance. I'm convinced that some wayward stranger in a space-craft, coming from some other part of the heavens, could look at earth and never know that it was inhabited at all. But the samw wayward stranger would certainly know instinctively that if the earth were inhabited, then the destinies of all who lived on it must inevitably be interwoven and joined. We are one hunk of ground, water, air, clouds, floating around in space. From out there it really is 'one world'.</p>
		<p><a href="#">This is a link.</a> I believe that space travel will one day become as common as airline travel is today. I’m convinced, however, that the true future of space travel does not lie with government agencies — NASA is still obsessed with the idea that the primary purpose of the space program is science — but real progress will come from private companies competing to provide the ultimate adventure ride, and NASA will receive the trickle-down benefits.</p>
