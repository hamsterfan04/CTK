<p id="featuredP">This piece is a drawing I made because I like fall a lot, so I wanted to draw a character in a fall setting. The character featured is Ryota Mitarai from the Danganronpa franchise. This piece was done digitally on my iPad, using ibisPaint. While drawing, I referenced many of my own personal photos during fall to capture the warm orange hues of the season.</p>
